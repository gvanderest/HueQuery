#HueQuery

A basic Hue control framework driven by jQuery. This project is extremely fresh, not only are we learning more about the Hue API itself, we are collaborating with very different scripting experience.

## First steps after this commit:
* Decide on a direction for UI
* Unify existing JavaScript/jQuery code and adhere to some arbitrary standards
* Build new UI
* Marvel at the Hue lights until we pass out
